# Handle events with Azure Functions and Azure Cosmos DB SQL API change feed

## Learning objectives

-   Create an Azure Function using the Azure Cosmos DB trigger

Configuring the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API trigger requires a JSON object within the bindings array. This object contains various properties that you can configure to change the behavior of the trigger. These properties include, but are not limited to:

**Property**

**Description**

**type**

This is statically set to **cosmosDBTrigger**

**name**

This is the name used for the method parameter that will map to this binding in code

**direction**

For a trigger, this will be set to **in**

**connectionStringSetting**

This is the name of the connection string in the function’s app settings

**databaseName**

The name of the database, which contains the container to monitor

**collectionName**

The name of the container to monitor

**leaseCollectionName**

The name of the container used to manage change feed leases

**createLeaseCollectionIfNotExists**

A boolean value to indicate if the Azure Functions runtime should create the lease container on your behalf if it does not already exist

An example of a trigger that monitors changes in the **cosmicworks** database and **products** container is included here. This trigger will use the change feed to monitor if new items are created or if existing items are updated.

```json
{ 
	"type": "cosmosDBTrigger", 
	"name": "changes", 
	"direction": "in", 
	"connectionStringSetting": "cosmosdbsqlconnstr", 
	"databaseName": "cosmicworks", 
	"collectionName": "products", 
	"leaseCollectionName": "productslease", 
	"createLeaseCollectionIfNotExists": false }
```
